Message, position and the style can be easyly modified through the plugin menu. 

The plugin will not add any CSS stylesheet or Javascript file but only inline script, what does not make your web site load more slowly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =

When a user visit your site, the plugin will check if this user has been already there, checking for a cookie that the plugin self creates (it is just a session cookie, so it is not against the law). If the user has not this cookie, a message will be shown (you can configure where, how and what will be show). If the users keeps surfing in your web, now or withing the next month, it means that he accepted the use of cookies in your website, so this message
will not be shown again.

= Why am I not seeing the message? =

Probably, you already have visited the site before, so you accepted the use of cookies and the plugin installed a cookie in your browser to know it. If you want to test if the plugin is working properly, try removing the cookies `displayCookieConsent` from your web browser or navigating in incognito mode. If you think that the plugin is not working properly, just open an issue here https://github.com/overclokk/italy-cookie-choices/issues and I will check it for you.
